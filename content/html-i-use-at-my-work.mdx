Hi there, i planned to write this blog long back but i faced few TypeScript warnings for code hightlighting in my markdown file, anyways let's start today topic i'll separate the HTML elements into categories

- Typography
- Layout
- Embeddings
- Elements

<H2>Typography</H2>

If you're familiar with any text editor like MS Word, Powerpoint, Google Docs you already know this🎉

![Beats logo vs My logo comparision](/blog/html-typography.png)

it's just text with different sizes, i use these Typography elements **h1, h2, h3, p, a, strong**

```tsx
// basic syntax of these elements

<h1>Hello World</h1>
<h2>Hello World</h2>
<h3>Hello World</h3>
<p>This is a paragraph</p>
<a
  href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/HTML/Introduction_to_HTML/HTML_text_fundamentals"
  >MDN Docs</a
>
<strong>I'm bold</strong>
```

Preview of the elements👇

# Hello World

## Hello World

### Hello World

This is a paragraph

**I'm bold**

<H2>Layout</H2>

Assume you'r building a website we'll divide the sections of website into blocks, and use these HTML elements **div, section, header, footer, main, aside**, this picture can explain you more👇

```tsx
// basic syntax of these layout elements
<header>Header</header>
<aside>Slider</aside>
<main>Content</main>
<footer>Footer</footer>

// these tags are mostly used for grouping elements
<div>
    <button>Get started</button>
</div>

<section>
    <h1>Hello there</h1>
    <p>My name is pavan</p>
</section>
```

Using these elements can contribute for better structure & even help in increasing Accessibility & SEO

<H2>Embeddings</H2>

You can go crazy here, you can literally run a website inside you're HTML file you just need the website URL, 💥boom done attach it to you're **iframe** element and i'll automatically render the website. Here is an example👇

```tsx
// This will render youtube inside your HTML file
<iframe src="https://youtube.com"></iframe>
```

Here i rendered a <mark>3D modal</mark> using <mark>Spline-3D</mark>

<iframe
  src="https://my.spline.design/molang3dcopy-e322e2236e97835094662d0d17977cda/"
  frameborder="0"
  width="100%"
  height="100%"
  style={{ height: "30rem", borderRadius: "0.5rem" }}
/>

<H2>Elements</H2>

I came to know few HTML elements recently like **time** which can be used for displaying date & time, this can increase your SEO here is an example👇

```tsx
<time datetime="2018-07-07">July 7</time>
```
